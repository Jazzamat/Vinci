# AIG-Net-I: Audio-Image Generation Network I

The proposed architecture attempts to learn the underlying relationship between audio and image data by training on pairs of song audio and corresponding album art. After training, the system should be able to generate album art from new song audio by passing the audio through the Audio Encoder and then the conditional model (GAN/Transformer) and Image Decoder.
